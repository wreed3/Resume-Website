                        <p>
                            Thank you for taking the time to allow me the opportunity to highlight some of my background and experience that will make me a great fit for your company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am a recent National Honor Society graduate from the University of Michigan-Flint, with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. I have been in IT services for over 10 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At Verizon wireless, I worked as a business consultant which gave me the ability to develop my interpersonal skills and communicate technical concepts to non-technical clients. Hereafter, as an Information Technology Administrator at Christ the Rock Apostolic Church (CTRAC), I have established and currently maintain the organization's technological infrastructure. Concurrently, I also work at the State of Michigan, as an Assistance Payments Worker, where I am known for my technological expertise and have assisted the local IT department in many capacities. As a result, I was hand-picked by senior leadership during one of the most trying health and business crisis in the world, to successfully aided in the transition of more than 140 workers to work remotely from home in 3 weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a student, I have had the opportunity to sharpen my skills and abilities to a whole new level. As a result, I have gained further experience in C++ and Java OOP languages, Oracle database design and administration, knowledge of SCRUM software development methodology, Cloud computing, UML (Unified Modeling Language) and software requirement gathering techniques in Software Engineering, Advanced Computer Networking, and Computer Architecture, just to name a few.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the last six months of 2020, I had the privilege to participate and receive a certification of completion in an SAP focused internship program called Practicum in Business Excellence, through Cornerstone Global L.L.C. As a result of this program, I received formal training and a secure foundation in the number one Enterprise Resource Planning software in the world, operating in modules such as Sales and Distribution, Material Management, Production Planning, and Financial and Management Accounting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I am participating in a Software Engineering Apprenticeship Program through LaunchCode. During this program I am diving deep into front in and backend development.
